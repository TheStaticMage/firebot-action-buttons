# Firebot Action Buttons

This [Firebot](https://firebot.app) plugin allows streamers to add interactive buttons directly in their chat feed to trigger custom actions.

## Compatibility

:warning: This plugin depends on features that do not exist yet in Firebot ([feature request here](https://github.com/crowbartools/Firebot/issues/3347)). I have implemented these features in a custom fork of Firebot to enable this plugin. **This plugin will not work properly on out-of-the-box Firebot.** Be aware that running a custom fork of Firebot comes with risks: no support from anyone, the risk of becoming "stuck" if I disappear and no longer keep this up-to-date, and a much narrower audience to discover potential bugs. If you do not fully understand these risks or are not comfortable digging into the code to investigate and fix problems, you should not use this. You can run from source from this branch: <https://github.com/TheStaticMage/Firebot/tree/running-release>. I do not publicly distribute compiled versions.

## Features

- Inject interactive buttons into the Firebot chat feed
- Map custom effect lists to each button
- Change button text, icon, alignment, and colors
- Multiple positioning strategies (append, prepend, after/before specific messages)
- Effects and automations to show and hide buttons and panels
