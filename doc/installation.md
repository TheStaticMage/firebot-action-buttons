# Installation

| Plugin Version | Minimum Firebot Version |
| --- | --- |
| 0.0.1+ | 5.65 |

## Installation: Plugin

1. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (**Settings** > **Scripts**) if you have not already done so.
2. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-action-buttons/releases), download `action-buttons-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (**File** > **Open Data Folder**, then select the "scripts" directory).
3. Go to **Settings** > **Scripts** > **Manage Startup Scripts** > **Add New Script** and add the `action-buttons-<version>.js` script.
4. Restart Firebot. (The plugin will _not_ load until you restart Firebot.)

## Configuration

The Action Buttons plugin is designed to work with the Firebot custom chat panel injection system. Once installed, it will be ready to inject interactive buttons into chat messages. Configuration happens at the script/integration level when you set up your custom workflows to use the action button features.

## Testing (Optional)

- Start Firebot after installation and confirm the plugin loads without errors.
- Trigger a basic workflow to ensure the plugin initializes as expected.
